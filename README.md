# Image Processor Final Project
## BME590 - Medcial Software Design
Authors: Matt Holbrook, Alan Register, Alex Guevara

### General information
Welcom to our final project for BME590! This project represents simple a 
cloud-based image processing platform. This 
includes a graphical user interface, or GUI, in which a user can specify 
images and processing methods and a server endpoint which performs all of the 
processing. Processed images are returned to the user to view and download.
