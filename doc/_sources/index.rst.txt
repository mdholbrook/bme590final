General information
=======================================
Welcome to our final project for BME590! This project represents simple a
cloud-based image processing platform. This includes a graphical user
interface, or GUI, in which a user can specify images and processing methods
and a server endpoint which performs all of the processing. Processed images
are  returned to the user to view and download.
